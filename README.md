# NeighborhoodBasedClusteringAlgorithm
*NBC* and *NBC.Lib* are a C# port of C++ implementation of Neighborhood-Based Clustering Algorithm [1]. 
If you are interesed [here](https://github.com/misiek1984/NBC) you'll find the C++ implementation.

This project contains references to projects that can be found in my other repository. 
See [Common](https://github.com/misiek1984/Common) for details.
If you want to compile *NeighborhoodBasedClusteringAlgorithm* locally, you also need to download *Common* repository.
Both repositories should be placed in the same directory.
